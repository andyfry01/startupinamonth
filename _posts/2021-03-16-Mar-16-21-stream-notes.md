excerpt: "Now a user can go through the whole process of adding content to the app!"

## Mantra
(a small idea to guide the day's work)

It always takes longer than you think it will 

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)
- Implement an uploaded photo browser and selector, which will "complete the cycle" of the photo upload and render process: 
  1. Upload a photo
  2. Select a layout template
  3. Pick an area of the layout template to add a photo to
  4. Pick a photo to add
  5. Render the right photo in the right place!

## What I got done
(plan != reality)
- Implemented a uploaded photo browser and selector! Now a user can go through the whole process of adding content to the app, both text and images, in addition to customizing its appearance ðŸ˜ƒ

## For next time
- Debug user info problems (our good friend Alice is still hard-coded into the active user state atom)
- Implement pic story saving and sharing feature
