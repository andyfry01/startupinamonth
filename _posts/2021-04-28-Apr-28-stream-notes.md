## Mantra

(a small idea to guide the day's work)

Get back on the horse üêé

## Plan

(what do I plan to do)

- Amazon SES is working! So we should figure out how to
  - Send emails (done this before, not hard üí™)
  - Receive emails (uh ...ü§î)
- If we can figure out how to receive emails, then ...
  - Take our parsing/DB saving code from yesterday and hook that up to email receiving flow

## What I got done

(plan != reality)

- We can now send emails from Mail File! Which is great. 
- We got most of the way towards **receiving** emails sent **to** Mail File as well: 
  - We wrote an SES receipt rule which invokes an AWS Lambda function when an email is received
  - That AWS Lambda function sends a POST to the Mail File server which we've written to receive emails

Theoretically that would be enough: SES would send the subject and body of the email along in the data that it sends to Lambda, but evidently an intermediary step is required along the way: either invoking an SNS event or saving the email to S3 first. Seems like an unneccessary middle step to this guy, but that's how it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## For next time

- Set up either SNS or S3 as the middle step between SES and Lambda, and after that we will have our email contents and can parse/save them accordingly üéâ
