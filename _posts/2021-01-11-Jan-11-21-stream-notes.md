## Stream stuff
- Build the whole thing on the stream, but...
    - There are things that I can't show
    - There are things that are boring to show
- News
    - Youtube channel!

## Plan for the morning
- Start on game itself!
    - Get a React/Reagent frontend going
        - Configure Clojurescript/Figwheel for building multiple JS files (one for React, one for landing page): DONE 👍
        - Get a helloworld React example up: DONE 👍
    - Set up a websocket server - ALMOST ⏳
    - Connect React clients to websocket server
    - Send some simple messages/data back and forth
