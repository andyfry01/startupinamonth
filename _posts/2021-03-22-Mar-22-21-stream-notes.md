## Mantra

(a small idea to guide the day's work)

Don't end the month with nothing

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)
- More CRUD finessing, focusing on the story editing flow. 

## What I got done
(plan != reality)

We could do all this from a code perspective for a while, but NOW we can do the following from the app UI itself: 

- Create a brand new story
- Save a brand new story in the database
- Get that new story's randomly generated URL, pass it back to the frontend, and redirect to a new route based on that URL. All of which enables the user: 
- To hit save once more on the same screen and EDIT that new story instead of creating a brand new story.
- Delete an existing story from the database!

CRUD finessing indeed ðŸ’ª

## For next time

- Fix our EDN-related data woes for hydrating app state from a saved story in the DB
- List out saved stories so a user can navigate to a saved story via the UI and view/edit it
