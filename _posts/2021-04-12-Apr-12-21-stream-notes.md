excerpt: "Created the Mail File landing page!"

## Mantra

(a small idea to guide the day's work)

I've learned a lot!

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)
- Introduce Mail File
- Start the buildout

## What I got done
(plan != reality)

- Created the Mail File landing page!
- And we got it to run locally via Vagrant!
- We tried to put it online, but were foiled by SSH key shenaningans and config problems.

## For next time

- Get the Mail File landing page up and running
- Work on Amazon SES config for emailing content to the service!
