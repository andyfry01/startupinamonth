## Mantra
(a small idea to guide the day's work)

If you're always behind, are you ever behind?

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)
- Integrate brand new user auth system into photo upload, story saving features, i.e.: organize uploads into the appropriate folder for each logged in user, and save generated stories for each user to a user-specific URL. 

## What I got done
(plan != reality)
- We got the app to save a picture to a specific folder for each user on upload! Big first step towards separating out assets by user for organization. 

## For next time
- Work on restricting requests for images according to which route you're on and which user you're signed in under
