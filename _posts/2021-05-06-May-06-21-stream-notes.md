## Mantra

(a small idea to guide the day's work)

Small is good. 

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)

Start writing some views for our DB contents!

1. Step one: just get something in the frontend
2. Step two: start looking into sorting options (first and foremost date)

## What I got done
(plan != reality)

- Well ... plan really didn't match up with reality this time. I spent a big chunk of the stream trying to debug Shadow-CLJS + Caddy websocket issues. Tech infrastructure stuff like this feels like a huge time suck in the moment, but it's important nevertheless to get it figured out, even if the time isn't going directly towards feature development.
- After that, we got re-posh + datascript integrated into the frontend! So far it's just a copy/paste of the [Todo MVC](https://github.com/denistakeda/re-posh/tree/master/examples/todomvc) example from the github repo, but it'll be a great basis for building on top of. 

## For next time

- Actually render something from the DB in the frontend.
