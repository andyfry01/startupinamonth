excerpt: "Reach goal: access the public version of a story with a custom URL"

## Mantra
(a small idea to guide the day's work)

Imperfect is ok. Even desirable!

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)
- Implement pic story saving and sharing feature, user should be able to:
  1. Make a story
  2. Give it a title 
  3. Save that story
  4. Reach goal: access the "public" version of that story with a URL
  5. Reach goal: reload a saved story for further editing, saving, etc. 

## What I got done
(plan != reality)

Quite a lot actually! We got most of the above finished: 

- User can make a story
- Give it a name
- Save it to the DB
- AND access it via a custom URL (reach goal number one)

So I'm pretty pleased ðŸ˜Š

## For next time
- Reload a saved story from the DB for further editing
- Some small stuff like adding a custom URL to the database object based on the title (currently it's hardcoded functionality, but URL should be based on story title).
